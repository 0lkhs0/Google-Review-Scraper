# Google-Review-Scraper

A python application used to scrape all the reviews of a business/service from a google url

## How it works

Enter a google url specifically showing the branch of the business/service.
The application will display the bussiness/service, address and the average rating.
The application will create a csv file storing all the reviews containing the review text, the rating given and the time period.
The application will allow more than one url to be uploaded and scraped.

Example of the Google url:

## Things I have learnt creating this application
1. Selenium 
  - Finding web elements
  - Finding xpaths
  - Accessing individual elements 
  - Spliting and obtaining the desired information 
2. Web Scraping
  - Beautiful soup (was working with bs4 libraries before finding out selenium works better for scraping google reviews)
3. GitHub 
  - Committing to repository 
  - Basic Git and Github functions

Will be working on utilising datasets from reviews on other data science projects
